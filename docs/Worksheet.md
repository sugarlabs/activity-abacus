Suggested for school years 6 - 8

### The Fraction abacus

Start Abacus ![](extras/Abacus-icon.png "fig:Abacus-icon.png"),

select the Fraction abacus.

Slide one of the 1/2 beads to represent 1/2

![](extras/Abacus1of2.jpg "Abacus1of2.jpg")

Another way to represent 1/2 is to slide half of another string of
fraction beads, for example slide 2 of the 1/4 beads. That is (2 x 1)/4
= 2/4 = 1/2

![](extras/Abacus2of4.jpg "Abacus2of4.jpg")

How many ways can you make 1/2, remember you can use 2 strings eg. 1/3 +
1/6 = 1/2

![](extras/Abacus3p6.jpg "Abacus3p6.jpg")

If using just one string, only some of the strings of beads can be used
to make 1/2. Which ones? Why?

Show that the solutions which use more than one string are correct, use
the Lowest Common Denominator
([LCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator)) method,
for example for the case of 1/3 +1/6 = 1/2

`1/3 + 1/6 =`\
`2/6 + 1/6 =`\
`(2+1)/6 =`\
`3/6 =`\
`1/2`

How do you know if you have found all the solutions?

Find all the ways to make 1/3 and 2/3

### Other representations of fraction addition

Draw your solutions as pie charts, you can use Paint, TurtleArt,
Socialcalc or Gnumeric in Gnome.

### The Caacupé abacus

Load the Caacupé abacus ![](extras/Abacuscaacupe.jpg "fig:Abacuscaacupe.jpg")

It can represent negative whole numbers and fractions. 1/2 can be
represented as 10 - 9 - 2/3 + 1/6

![](extras/Abacus10931.jpg "Abacus10931.jpg")

How many different ways can you represent 1/2 , 1/3, 2/3

How do you know when you have found them all?

Similar to the Pie chart, can you think of a way to visually represent
the addition of positive and negative fractions?
